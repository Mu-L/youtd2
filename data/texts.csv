"3XT5","Some tower stats are affected by [color=GOLD]diminishing returns[/color]. These stats will get less effect from items, auras and other modifications once the stat goes above 170% or below 60%. This means that you should avoid stacking all of the bonuses for these stats on a single tower and try to spread the power around evenly to all of your towers.
 
All of the stats in the [color=GOLD]Misc[/color] section in [color=GOLD]Tower Details[/color] are affected by [color=GOLD]diminishing returns[/color]:
- Bounty ratio
- Exp ratio
- Item drop ratio
- Item quality ratio
- Trigger chances
- Buff duration
- Debuff duration
"
"ENAD","In general, when two copies of the same tower attempt to apply the same buff on a unit, the buffs will not stack. For example, if you got two copies of the same tower which slows creeps by 10%, then total effect will be 10%, not 20%! Buffs from towers at different upgrade levels but in same family will also not stack.
 
There are exceptions, in which case the ability tooltip will mention that buffs stacks.
 
Note that this also applies to items with abilities.
"
"WH6F","Towers continue to get experience from kills even after reaching the max level. There are items which transfer experience from one tower to another. Try to use such items on max level towers to distribute the extra experience.
"
"PUPD","It is a good idea to focus on improving the damage output of a few towers - such towers are called [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers. You should apply all oils on [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers and equip them with the best items. This way, all of the power bonuses will combine and complement each other.
 
Not all towers are well suited to be [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower. For example, a tower with only one aura ability and no damage enhancing abilities is most likely a bad [color=GOLD]Carry[/color].
"
"K19J","[color=GOLD]Support[/color] towers are towers which do not deal as much damage as [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers but have valuable abilities which empower other towers.
 
Such towers should be built strategically next to [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers to make them even more powerful.
"
"JAJI","[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower attacks...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On attack, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower attacks, at the moment when the tower launches the projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities trigger only once per attack, even if the tower has [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color], [color=GOLD]bounce attack[/color] or [color=GOLD]multishot attack[/color].
 
[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities will trigger even if the attack misses or somehow deals 0 damage.
"
"R82O","[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower hits a creep...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On hit, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower hits a creep with an attack projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities trigger for every hit of the attack unless otherwise stated in the tooltip. If the ability tooltip says that the ability affects only the [color=GOLD]main target[/color], then this ability will not trigger for secondary targets of a [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color] for example.
 
For [color=GOLD]splash attacks[/color], the main creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color]. For [color=GOLD]multishot attacks[/color], one of the targets is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color]. For [color=GOLD]bounce attacks[/color], the first hit creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color].
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will trigger even if the attack projectile somehow deals 0 damage.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will not trigger from damage dealt by tower abilities or item abilities. For example, if a tower is carrying an item which sometimes shoots a projectile at a creep, the hits from this projectile will not trigger [color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities.
"
"3ZTG","[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower uses an [color=GOLD]active ability[/color]. Passive abilities don't count even if they have a cooldown.
 
[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities sometimes include more specific conditions like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell on a friendly tower...][/color]. In such cases, the ability will trigger only when the tower uses an active [color=GOLD]targeted[/color] ability on a friendly tower. You can check if the ability is targeted by trying to cast it yourself and seeing if there's a targeting cursor.
"
"34UQ","Some abilities will mention that they have an [color=GOLD]Attack speed adjusted chance[/color] to trigger. What this means is that if the ability has a base 10% chance to trigger on attack, then this ability will trigger at the same rate for towers with different attack speeds.
 
For a tower with 1.0 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 1.0 = 0.10 = 10%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
 
For a tower with 0.5 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05 = 5%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
"
"258N","Not all damage increasing stats are the same, some can increase total damage by more than others because they are [color=GOLD]multiplicative[/color].
 
Here's an example:
 
You have a tower with 100 base damage, 1s attack speed, 0% crit chance. The tower has 2 inventory slots and you have 3 items:
Item A gives +40% attack damage
Item B gives +40% attack damage
Item C gives +40% damage to bosses
 
Let's say that the next wave will be a boss.
 
If you equip Item A and Item B, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 180[/color] damage.
 
If you equip Item A and Item C, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4) * (1.0 + 0.4) = 196[/color] damage.
 
As you can see, Item C looks like it should provide the same increase as other items but in reality the actual bonus is greater.
 
In general, stats are broken down into categories. Stats within one category are additive while stats between categories multiply with each other. Here's a list of all categories which can affect damage:
 
- Base attack damage flat
- Base attack damage %
- Attack damage flat
- Attack damage %
- Attack speed
- Spell damage %
- Damage against creep armor type
- Damage against creep category
- Attack damage received % (on creep)
- Spell damage received % (on creep)
- Damage received from element % (on creep)
- Damage reduction from armor (on creep)

Note that crit chance, crit damage and multicrit can also be considered multiplicative with other categories.

[color=GOLD]Buff duration:[/color] Modifies the duration of buffs cast by this tower. For example, if a tower has 200% buff duration and uses an ability which buffs another tower for 6 seconds, the buff will last 12 sec.
 
[color=GOLD]Debuff duration:[/color] Same as Buff duration but affects the duration of debuffs.
 
[color=GOLD]Trigger chances:[/color] Modifies the chances of chanced abilities. Example: Tower ability grants 10% chance to deal extra damage and the tower has +20% trigger chances. The actual chance of ability will be [color=GOLD]10% * 1.2[/color] = 12%.
 
[color=GOLD]Item drop ratio:[/color] Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to drop an item. Example: Creep killed by a tower with 50% item drop ratio => creep is 50% more likely to drop an item.
 
[color=GOLD]Item quality ratio:[/color] Creeps killed by this tower have a modified chance to drop items with higher rarity.
 
[color=GOLD]Bounty ratio:[/color] Modifies the amount of bounty received for kills done by this tower.
"
"XDM6","You can [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] a tower to make it stronger. Select a tower and you will see the [color=GOLD]Upgrade[/color] button on the left side of the tower menu.

Note that you cannot [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] in [color=GOLD]Totally random[/color] game mode.
"
"5RTO","You can [color=GOLD]transform[/color] a tower into a different one by building a tower on top of another tower. Experience, items and oils will carry over.
 
Transforming refunds the cost of the previous tower. 100% if towers are in the same family and 75% if they are from different families.
 
Note that you cannot [color=GOLD]transform[/color] in [color=GOLD]Build[/color] game mode.
"
"836J","Many towers have aura's which provide benefits to other towers nearby. You should try to build towers [color=GOLD]next to each other[/color] to maximize the benefits of aura's.
"
"8TLT","Towers can deal different types of damage.
 
Normal tower attacks and some abilities will deal [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color]. Attack damage is dealt as the [color=GOLD]attack type[/color] of the tower ([color=TAN]Physical[/color], [color=MEDIUM_PURPLE]Decay[/color], etc). Attack damage is reduced by creep armor and deals different ratios of damage depending on the [color=GOLD]armor type[/color] of the creep.
 
Some tower abilities will deal [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color]. Spell damage ignores creep armor but some creeps are 100% immune to spell damage.
 
Make sure to equip your towers appropriately based on their main damage source. For example, towers which deal primarily [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color] will not get any benefit from oils which increase [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color].
"
"UECA","When towers make a critical hit, the attack will deal more damage than unusual. The base bonus is 50% more damage. Note that both normal attacks and spell damage can be critical.
"
"QQTB","Towers can crit multiple times in the same attack which will cause the attack to deal extra damage. The maximum number of multicrits is determined by the tower's [color=GOLD]Multicrit[/color] stat.

Note that each subsequent multicrit has a reduced chance (80% of previous).
 
Example: A tower has 10% critical chance, 50% critical damage bonus and multicrit of 3.
- The tower has a [color=GOLD]10%[/color] chance to crit the first time and deal 1.5x damage
- If the tower has critted once, then it has a [color=GOLD]10%*0.8=8%[/color] chance to crit again, for the second time, and deal [color=GOLD]1.5+0.5=2x[/color] normal damage.
- If the tower has critted twice, then it has a [color=GOLD]10%*0.8*0.8=6.4%[/color] chance to crit again, for the third time, and deal [color=GOLD]1.5+0.5+0.5=2.5x[/color] normal damage.
 
Each subsequent multicrit requires that previous crit succeeded.
 
Only [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color] can multicrit, [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color] can only crit once.
"
"TQUN","Towers gain experience when they kill creeps and once they get enough experience, their level increases. Leveling up increases the power of tower abilities and some items.
 
In addition, all towers gain bonuses to the following stats when they level up:
 
+0.15% crit chance
+2% crit damage
+0.15% spell crit chance
+2% spell crit damage
+4% base damage
+1% attack speed"
"VRQV","Towers have different [color=GOLD]attack types[/color]. Possible [color=GOLD]attack types[/color] are:
 
[color=TAN]Physical[/color], [color=MEDIUM_PURPLE]Decay[/color], [color=DODGER_BLUE]Energy[/color], [color=AQUAMARINE]Essence[/color], [color=CORNFLOWER_BLUE]Elemental[/color] and [color=DEEP_SKY_BLUE]Arcane[/color].
 
Each [color=GOLD]attack type[/color] deals different amounts of damage to [color=GOLD]armor types[/color]. Most [color=GOLD]attack types[/color] deal extra damage to some armor while dealing less to others. The exceptions are [color=AQUAMARINE]Essence[/color] and [color=DEEP_SKY_BLUE]Arcane[/color] [color=GOLD]attack types[/color]. In general, it is a good idea to build towers with diverse [color=GOLD]attack types[/color].
 
You can check the stats of a tower's [color=GOLD]attack type[/color] by selecting the tower and then mousing over the [color=GOLD]attack type[/color] in the tower menu.
"
"7H17","Towers gain experience only when they deal [color=GOLD]killing blows[/color]. This means that even if some tower attacked a creep many times, it will not get any experience if the creep was killed by another tower. In general, towers with highest damage will tend to deal the majority of [color=GOLD]killing blows[/color] and therefore will gain the most experience.
 
The dealer of the [color=GOLD]killing blow[/color] is also important because that tower's stats will be used to calculate bounty, item chance and item quality. Make sure that you equip items which affect these stats on towers which actually get kills. Equipping such items on towers which never get kills will give you almost no benefit. You can see which tower has the most kills in the [color=GOLD]Game Stats[/color] panel. You can also check each tower's kill counts in the tower details panel."
"6R2P","Towers can be assigned to [color=GOLD]buff groups[/color]. Select a tower and you will see buttons for [color=GOLD]buff groups[/color] on top of the tower menu.
 
Mouse over the [color=GOLD]buff group[/color] buttons to read more details.
 
[color=GOLD]Buff groups[/color] can be used to create powerful setups between [color=GOLD]Buffing[/color] towers and [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers. An example setup could be:
- [color=GOLD]Buffing[/color] tower is assigned to CASTER [color=GOLD]buff group[/color] 1
- [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower is assigned to RECEIVER [color=GOLD]buff group[/color] 1

As a result, the buffing tower will only cast buffs on the [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower. Normally, buffing towers will choose targets randomly but with this setup you will maximize the gain from the buffs.

You have finished a wave! Finishing a wave grants multiple rewards:
 
You get new random towers. Check your [color=GOLD]Tower stash[/color]!
 
You get a gold bonus called [color=GOLD]Income[/color].
 
You get new [color=GOLD]Knowledge tomes[/color], which are used for researching elements."
"49AV","The next wave will be a [color=GOLD]Challenge[/color] wave. These waves are harder than normal and it's very likely that you won't be able to kill the creep. That's ok because [color=GOLD]Challenge[/color] waves deal no portal damage. Use these waves to test the power of your towers."

At this point, you might be able to [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] one of your towers. Try selecting different towers and checking if you can [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] them.
 
[color=GOLD]Upgrading[/color] changes a tower into a more powerful version with improved stats and abilities.
 
It's a good idea to [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] towers with highest levels first.

Another way build powerful defenses is by [color=GOLD]transforming[/color] towers.
 
To [color=GOLD]transform[/color] a tower, start building a tower like you normally would but move the mouse to an existing tower. The tower cursor will turn blue to indicate that you can [color=GOLD]transform[/color] it. Click to complete the process.
 
[color=GOLD]Transforming[/color] replaces a tower with a new tower, keeps the level of the previous tower and also refunds the cost of the previous tower!
 
If you built a tower long time ago and it's not as powerful anymore, [color=GOLD]transforming[/color] it into a more powerful tower is a good strategy.
