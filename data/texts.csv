3XT5,"Some tower stats are affected by [color=GOLD]diminishing returns[/color]. These stats will get less effect from items, auras and other modifications once the stat goes above 170% or below 60%. This means that you should avoid stacking all of the bonuses for these stats on a single tower and try to spread the power around evenly to all of your towers.
 
All of the stats in the [color=GOLD]Misc[/color] section in [color=GOLD]Tower Details[/color] are affected by [color=GOLD]diminishing returns[/color]:
- Bounty ratio
- Exp ratio
- Item drop ratio
- Item quality ratio
- Trigger chances
- Buff duration
- Debuff duration
","防御塔的部分属性会受到 [color=GOLD]边际效用递减[/color] 的影响。当这些属性超过170%或低于60%时，来自装备、光环及其它加成的效果将会衰减。这意味着您应当避免将所有加成集中堆叠于单个防御塔，而应将强化效果平均分配给所有防御塔。

在[color=GOLD]「防御塔详情」[/color]的 [color=GOLD]「杂项」[/color]分类中，以下属性均受 [color=GOLD]边际效用递减[/color] 的影响：
- 赏金获取率
- 经验值获取率
- 物品掉落率
- 物品品质率
- 触发几率
- 增益状态持续时间
- 负面状态持续时间"
ENAD,"In general, when two copies of the same tower attempt to apply the same buff on a unit, the buffs will not stack. For example, if you got two copies of the same tower which slows creeps by 10%, then total effect will be 10%, not 20%! Buffs from towers at different upgrade levels but in same family will also not stack.
 
There are exceptions, in which case the ability tooltip will mention that buffs stacks.
 
Note that this also applies to items with abilities.
","通常情况下，当两个相同类型的防御塔试图对单位施加同种增益状态时，效果不会叠加。例如：若你拥有两座能使小兵减速10%的同类型防御塔，实际总效果仍为10%而非20%！来自同一系列但不同升级等级塔的增益状态同样无法叠加。

部分特殊增益状态可叠加，这类情况会在能力说明中特别标注""可叠加""。

请注意该规则同样适用于带有能力的装备。 "
WH6F,"Towers continue to get experience from kills even after reaching the max level. There are items which transfer experience from one tower to another. Try to use such items on max level towers to distribute the extra experience.
",防御塔在达到最高等级后仍可通过击杀获取经验值。游戏内存在一些可将经验值从一座防御塔转移至另一座的特殊装备。请尽量在满级防御塔上使用此类装备，以分配其溢出的经验值。
PUPD,"It is a good idea to focus on improving the damage output of a few towers - such towers are called [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers. You should apply all oils on [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers and equip them with the best items. This way, all of the power bonuses will combine and complement each other.
 
Not all towers are well suited to be [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower. For example, a tower with only one aura ability and no damage enhancing abilities is most likely a bad [color=GOLD]Carry[/color].
","建议优先集中强化少量防御塔的输出能力——这类防御塔被称为[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔。你应将所有强化油集中用于[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔，并为它们配备最佳装备。通过这种方式，各类战力加成将产生叠加互补效应。

并非所有防御塔都适合作为[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔。例如仅具备单一光环能力且无伤害增幅能力的防御塔，通常不适合担任[color=GOLD]核心[/color]角色。"
K19J,"[color=GOLD]Support[/color] towers are towers which do not deal as much damage as [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers but have valuable abilities which empower other towers.
 
Such towers should be built strategically next to [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers to make them even more powerful.

JAJI,"[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower attacks...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On attack, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower attacks, at the moment when the tower launches the projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities trigger only once per attack, even if the tower has [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color], [color=GOLD]bounce attack[/color] or [color=GOLD]multishot attack[/color].

R82O,"[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower hits a creep...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On hit, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower hits a creep with an attack projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities trigger for every hit of the attack unless otherwise stated in the tooltip. If the ability tooltip says that the ability affects only the [color=GOLD]main target[/color], then this ability will not trigger for secondary targets of a [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color] for example.
 
For [color=GOLD]splash attacks[/color], the main creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color].

For [color=GOLD]bounce attacks[/color], the first hit creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color].
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will trigger even if the attack projectile somehow deals 0 damage.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will not trigger from damage dealt by tower abilities or item abilities. For example, if a tower is carrying an item which sometimes shoots a projectile at a creep, the hits from this projectile will not trigger [color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities.
","[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能指包含""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔命中小兵……][/color]""或""[color=GOLD][命中时，该防御塔……][/color]""描述的技能。此类技能会在防御塔的弹道攻击命中小兵时激活。

除非技能说明特别标注，[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能会对攻击命中的每个目标生效。若技能说明标注仅对[color=GOLD]主要目标[/color]生效，则该技能不会作用于[color=GOLD]溅射攻击[/color]的次要目标等其他情形。

3ZTG,"[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower uses an [color=GOLD]active ability[/color]. Passive abilities don't count even if they have a cooldown.
 
[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities sometimes include more specific conditions like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell on a friendly tower...][/color]. In such cases, the ability will trigger only when the tower uses an active [color=GOLD]targeted[/color] ability on a friendly tower. You can check if the ability is targeted by trying to cast it yourself and seeing if there's a targeting cursor.
","[color=GOLD]施法触发[/color]型技能指包含""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔施放法术……][/color]""描述的技能。此类技能会在防御塔使用[color=GOLD]主动技能[/color]时激活——即使被动技能存在冷却时间，其使用也不会触发效果。

部分[color=GOLD]施法触发[/color]型技能会限定更具体条件，例如""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔对友方防御塔施放法术……][/color]""。此类情况下，只有当防御塔对友方防御塔使用主动的[color=GOLD]指向性[/color]技能时才会触发。可通过手动施放技能观察是否出现瞄准光标来判断该技能是否为指向性技能。 "
34UQ,"Some abilities will mention that they have an [color=GOLD]Attack speed adjusted chance[/color] to trigger. What this means is that if the ability has a base 10% chance to trigger on attack, then this ability will trigger at the same rate for towers with different attack speeds.
 
For a tower with 1.0 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 1.0 = 0.10 = 10%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
 
For a tower with 0.5 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05 = 5%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
","若某技能描述提及具备[color=GOLD]攻速加权的触发几率[/color]，则意味着其基础触发概率会根据防御塔攻击速度动态适配。例如：某技能在攻击时具有10%基础触发几率，不同攻速的防御塔最终触发频率将保持一致。

例如：
攻击速度为1.0秒的防御塔，实际触发概率为[color=GOLD][0.10 × 1.0 = 0.10 = 10%][/color]，即平均每10秒触发一次。
攻击速度为0.5秒的防御塔，实际触发概率为[color=GOLD][0.10 × 0.5 = 0.05 = 5%][/color]，但同样平均每10秒触发一次。 "
258N,"Not all damage increasing stats are the same, some can increase total damage by more than others because they are [color=GOLD]multiplicative[/color].
 
Here's an example:
 
You have a tower with 100 base damage, 1s attack speed, 0% crit chance. The tower has 2 inventory slots and you have 3 items:
Item A gives +40% attack damage
Item B gives +40% attack damage
Item C gives +40% damage to bosses
 
Let's say that the next wave will be a boss.
 
If you equip Item A and Item B, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 180[/color] damage.
 
If you equip Item A and Item C, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4) * (1.0 + 0.4) = 196[/color] damage.
 
As you can see, Item C looks like it should provide the same increase as other items but in reality the actual bonus is greater.
 
In general, stats are broken down into categories. Stats within one category are additive while stats between categories multiply with each other. Here's a list of all categories which can affect damage:
 
- Base attack damage flat
- Base attack damage %
- Attack damage flat
- Attack damage %
- Attack speed
- Spell damage %
- Damage against creep armor type
- Damage against creep category
- Attack damage received % (on creep)
- Spell damage received % (on creep)
- Damage received from element % (on creep)
- Damage reduction from armor (on creep)

Note that crit chance, crit damage and multicrit can also be considered multiplicative with other categories.
","并非所有伤害增益属性都以相同方式计算，部分具备[color=GOLD]乘算叠加[/color]特性的属性可产生更高的总伤害增幅。

示例说明：

假设某防御塔基础攻击力100点，攻击速度1秒/次，无暴击属性。现有三件装备：
装备A：攻击伤害+40%
装备B：攻击伤害+40%
装备C：对首领伤害+40%

若下波敌人为首领：

佩戴装备A+B时，伤害计算为：
[color=GOLD]100 × (1.0 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 180[/color]

佩戴装备A+C时，伤害计算为
[color=GOLD]100 × (1.0 + 0.4) × (1.0 + 0.4) = 196[/color]

由此可见，相同数值的乘算型增益（装备C）实际效果优于加算型增益。

同类别属性以加算叠加，跨类别属性以乘算叠加。影响伤害的主要属性类别包括：

- 基础攻击力固定值
- 基础攻击力百分比
- 攻击力固定值
- 攻击力百分比
- 攻击速度
- 法术伤害百分比
- 对特定护甲类型伤害
- 对特定兵种伤害
- 敌方受到攻击伤害百分比
- 敌方受到法术伤害百分比
- 敌方受到元素伤害百分比
- 敌方护甲减伤值

注：暴击几率、暴击伤害与多重暴击属性也与其他类别形成乘算关系。 "

8TLT,"Towers can deal different types of damage.
 
Normal tower attacks and some abilities will deal [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color]. Attack damage is dealt as the [color=GOLD]attack type[/color] of the tower ([color=TAN]Physical[/color], [color=MEDIUM_PURPLE]Decay[/color], etc). Attack damage is reduced by creep armor and deals different ratios of damage depending on the [color=GOLD]armor type[/color] of the creep.
 
Some tower abilities will deal [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color]. Spell damage ignores creep armor but some creeps are 100% immune to spell damage.
 
Make sure to equip your towers appropriately based on their main damage source. For example, towers which deal primarily [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color] will not get any benefit from oils which increase [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color].
","防御塔可造成不同类型的伤害：

普通攻击及部分技能造成[color=GOLD]攻击伤害[/color]。攻击伤害类型取决于防御塔的[color=GOLD]攻击类型[/color]（如[color=TAN]物理[/color]、[color=MEDIUM_PURPLE]腐化[/color]等），其伤害受敌人护甲影响，并根据敌人的[color=GOLD]护甲类型[/color]产生不同伤害比例。

部分技能造成[color=GOLD]法术伤害[/color]。法术伤害无视护甲，但某些敌人对法术伤害免疫。

请根据防御塔的主要伤害类型合理搭配装备。例如：以[color=GOLD]攻击伤害[/color]为主的防御塔无法从提升[color=GOLD]法术伤害[/color]的强化油中获益。   "
UECA,"When towers make a critical hit, the attack will deal more damage than unusual. The base bonus is 50% more damage. Note that both normal attacks and spell damage can be critical.
",当防御塔触发暴击时，攻击将造成更高伤害（基础加成为50%）。注意：普通攻击和法术伤害均可暴击。  
QQTB,"Towers can crit multiple times in the same attack which will cause the attack to deal extra damage. The maximum number of multicrits is determined by the tower's [color=GOLD]Multicrit[/color] stat.

Note that each subsequent multicrit has a reduced chance (80% of previous).
 
Example: A tower has 10% critical chance, 50% critical damage bonus and multicrit of 3.
- The tower has a [color=GOLD]10%[/color] chance to crit the first time and deal 1.5x damage
- If the tower has critted once, then it has a [color=GOLD]10%*0.8=8%[/color] chance to crit again, for the second time, and deal [color=GOLD]1.5+0.5=2x[/color] normal damage.
- If the tower has critted twice, then it has a [color=GOLD]10%*0.8*0.8=6.4%[/color] chance to crit again, for the third time, and deal [color=GOLD]1.5+0.5+0.5=2.5x[/color] normal damage.
 
Each subsequent multicrit requires that previous crit succeeded.
 
Only [color=GOLD]attack damage[/color] can multicrit, [color=GOLD]spell damage[/color] can only crit once.
","防御塔可在单次攻击中触发多次暴击，造成额外伤害。最大多重暴击次数由防御塔的[color=GOLD]多重暴击[/color]属性决定。 

注：后续每次暴击的触发几率递减（前一次的80%）。 

示例：防御塔拥有10%暴击几率、50%暴击伤害加成及3次多重暴击能力。
- 首次暴击几率为[color=GOLD]10%[/color]，造成1.5倍伤害
- 若首次暴击成功，则第二次暴击几率为[color=GOLD]10%*0.8=8%[/color]，总伤害倍率提升至2倍
- 若第二次暴击成功，则第三次暴击几率为[color=GOLD]10%*0.8*0.8=6.4%[/color]，总伤害倍率提升至2.5倍

后续每次暴击需前一次成功触发。

7H17,"Towers gain experience only when they deal [color=GOLD]killing blows[/color]. This means that even if some tower attacked a creep many times, it will not get any experience if the creep was killed by another tower. In general, towers with highest damage will tend to deal the majority of [color=GOLD]killing blows[/color] and therefore will gain the most experience.
 
The dealer of the [color=GOLD]killing blow[/color] is also important because that tower's stats will be used to calculate bounty, item chance and item quality. Make sure that you equip items which affect these stats on towers which actually get kills. Equipping such items on towers which never get kills will give you almost no benefit. You can see which tower has the most kills in the [color=GOLD]Game Stats[/color] panel. You can also check each tower's kill counts in the tower details panel.","防御塔仅通过[color=GOLD]致命一击[/color]获得经验。即使某防御塔多次攻击敌人，若最终击杀由其他防御塔完成，则无法获得经验。通常高伤害防御塔更容易完成[color=GOLD]致命一击[/color]，从而快速升级。

[color=GOLD]致命一击[/color]的判定还影响赏金、物品掉落率及品质率计算。请确保影响这些属性的装备配置在能实际完成击杀的防御塔上。通过[color=GOLD]游戏统计[/color]面板可查看各防御塔击杀数。"

- [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower is assigned to RECEIVER [color=GOLD]buff group[/color] 1

As a result, the buffing tower will only cast buffs on the [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower. Normally, buffing towers will choose targets randomly but with this setup you will maximize the gain from the buffs.
