"Protect the portal","The main point of the game is to [color=GOLD]protect the portal[/color]. If a creep reaches the portal it will deal damage to it. Once portal health reaches 0 the game is over. To prevent that, build towers so that they kill creeps before they reach the portal."
"Income","After finishing a wave you will gain a gold bonus called [color=GOLD]Income[/color]. This extra gold amount is made up of two components: [color=GOLD]upkeep[/color] and [color=GOLD]interest[/color]. 
 
[color=GOLD]Upkeep[/color] depends on current wave level and will increase as the game progresses.
 
[color=GOLD]Interest[/color] is equal to [color=GOLD][0.05 * current gold][/color].
 
Both [color=GOLD]upkeep[/color] and [color=GOLD]interest[/color] rates can be increased with some rare items and abilities.
 
The amount of upkeep and interest gained will be displayed on the left side of the screen after a wave."
"Choosing Elements","A particular element can be strong or weak against a creep type. Try to choose [color=GOLD]a diverse set of elements[/color] to make sure that your towers can deal well with all types of creeps.
 
It's a good idea to focus on 2-3 elements.
"
"Game Modes","YouTD can be played in three game modes:
 
[color=GOLD]Build Mode[/color]. Build towers and upgrade them. This mode is most similar to other Tower Defense games. It's recommended to play this mode only to learn the game because random modes are more fun.
 
[color=GOLD]Random with upgrade[/color]. You receive random towers after each wave, based on the elements that you have researched. Note that all towers you receive will be from the first tier and need to be upgraded. You can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses.
 
[color=GOLD]Totally random[/color]. You receive totally random towers. Towers cannot be upgraded but you can replace towers to carry over permanent bonuses."
"Researching","Always use your [color=GOLD]knowledge tomes[/color] as early as possible to increase the chances of getting more powerful towers."
