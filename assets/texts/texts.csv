These stats will get less effect from items, auras and other modifications once the stat goes above 170% or below 60%. This means that you should avoid stacking all of the bonuses for these stats on a single tower and try to spread the power around evenly to all of your towers.

- Bounty ratio

- Debuff duration
","防御塔的部分属性会受到 [color=GOLD]边际效用递减[/color] 的影响。当这些属性超过170%或低于60%时，来自装备、光环及其它加成的效果将会衰减。这意味着您应当避免将所有加成集中堆叠于单个防御塔，而应将强化效果平均分配给所有防御塔。

在[color=GOLD]「防御塔详情」[/color]的 [color=GOLD]「杂项」[/color]分类中，以下属性均受 [color=GOLD]边际效用递减[/color] 的影响：

"ENAD","In general, when two copies of the same tower attempt to apply the same buff on a unit, the buffs will not stack. For example, if you got two copies of the same tower which slows creeps by 10%, then total effect will be 10%, not 20%! Buffs from towers at different upgrade levels but in same family will also not stack.
 
There are exceptions, in which case the ability tooltip will mention that buffs stacks.
 
Note that this also applies to items with abilities.
","通常情况下，当两个相同类型的防御塔试图对单位施加同种增益状态时，效果不会叠加。例如：若你拥有两座能使小兵减速10%的同类型防御塔，实际总效果仍为10%而非20%！来自同一系列但不同升级等级塔的增益状态同样无法叠加。

部分特殊增益状态可叠加，这类情况会在能力说明中特别标注""可叠加""。

请注意该规则同样适用于带有能力的装备。"
"WH6F","Towers continue to get experience from kills even after reaching the max level. There are items which transfer experience from one tower to another. Try to use such items on max level towers to distribute the extra experience.
","防御塔在达到最高等级后仍可通过击杀获取经验值。游戏内存在一些可将经验值从一座防御塔转移至另一座的特殊装备。请尽量在满级防御塔上使用此类装备，以分配其溢出的经验值。"
"PUPD","It is a good idea to focus on improving the damage output of a few towers - such towers are called [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers. You should apply all oils on [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers and equip them with the best items. This way, all of the power bonuses will combine and complement each other.
 
Not all towers are well suited to be [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] tower. For example, a tower with only one aura ability and no damage enhancing abilities is most likely a bad [color=GOLD]Carry[/color].
","建议优先集中强化少量防御塔的输出能力——这类防御塔被称为[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔。你应将所有强化油集中用于[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔，并为它们配备最佳装备。通过这种方式，各类战力加成将产生叠加互补效应。

并非所有防御塔都适合作为[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔。例如仅具备单一光环能力且无伤害增幅能力的防御塔，通常不适合担任[color=GOLD]核心[/color]角色。"
"K19J","[color=GOLD]Support[/color] towers are towers which do not deal as much damage as [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers but have valuable abilities which empower other towers.
 
Such towers should be built strategically next to [color=GOLD]Carry[/color] towers to make them even more powerful.
","[color=GOLD]辅助[/color]防御塔虽然输出能力不及[color=GOLD]核心[/color]防御塔，但具备能强化其他防御塔的宝贵增益技能。

"JAJI","[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower attacks...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On attack, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower attacks, at the moment when the tower launches the projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On attack[/color] abilities trigger only once per attack, even if the tower has [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color], [color=GOLD]bounce attack[/color] or [color=GOLD]multishot attack[/color].

即使防御塔具备[color=GOLD]溅射攻击[/color]、[color=GOLD]弹射攻击[/color]或[color=GOLD]多重射击[/color]特性，[color=GOLD]攻击触发[/color]型技能每次攻击仍仅生效一次。

"R82O","[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower hits a creep...][/color] or [color=GOLD][On hit, this tower...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower hits a creep with an attack projectile.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities trigger for every hit of the attack unless otherwise stated in the tooltip. If the ability tooltip says that the ability affects only the [color=GOLD]main target[/color], then this ability will not trigger for secondary targets of a [color=GOLD]splash attack[/color] for example.
 
For [color=GOLD]splash attacks[/color], the main creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color]. For [color=GOLD]multishot attacks[/color], one of the targets is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color]. For [color=GOLD]bounce attacks[/color], the first hit creep is considered to be the [color=GOLD]main target[/color].
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will trigger even if the attack projectile somehow deals 0 damage.
 
[color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities will not trigger from damage dealt by tower abilities or item abilities. For example, if a tower is carrying an item which sometimes shoots a projectile at a creep, the hits from this projectile will not trigger [color=GOLD]On hit[/color] abilities.
","[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能指包含""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔命中小兵……][/color]""或""[color=GOLD][命中时，该防御塔……][/color]""描述的技能。此类技能会在防御塔的弹道攻击命中小兵时激活。

除非技能说明特别标注，[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能会对攻击命中的每个目标生效。若技能说明标注仅对[color=GOLD]主要目标[/color]生效，则该技能不会作用于[color=GOLD]溅射攻击[/color]的次要目标等其他情形。

[color=GOLD]溅射攻击[/color]中被直接命中的小兵视为[color=GOLD]主要目标[/color]
[color=GOLD]多重射击[/color]中随机选取一个目标作为[color=GOLD]主要目标[/color]
[color=GOLD]弹射攻击[/color]中首个被击中的小兵视为[color=GOLD]主要目标[/color]

即使弹道攻击造成0点伤害，[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能依然会激活。

由防御塔技能或装备上的技能造成的伤害（例如携带装备触发的额外弹道攻击）不会激活[color=GOLD]命中触发[/color]型技能。"
"3ZTG","[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities are abilities which contain text like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell...][/color]. Such abilities are triggered when the tower uses an [color=GOLD]active ability[/color]. Passive abilities don't count even if they have a cooldown.
 
[color=GOLD]On spell cast[/color] abilities sometimes include more specific conditions like [color=GOLD][Whenever this tower casts a spell on a friendly tower...][/color]. In such cases, the ability will trigger only when the tower uses an active [color=GOLD]targeted[/color] ability on a friendly tower. You can check if the ability is targeted by trying to cast it yourself and seeing if there's a targeting cursor.
","[color=GOLD]施法触发[/color]型技能指包含""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔施放法术……][/color]""描述的技能。此类技能会在防御塔使用[color=GOLD]主动技能[/color]时激活——即使被动技能存在冷却时间，其使用也不会触发效果。

部分[color=GOLD]施法触发[/color]型技能会限定更具体条件，例如""[color=GOLD][每当该防御塔对友方防御塔施放法术……][/color]""。此类情况下，只有当防御塔对友方防御塔使用主动的[color=GOLD]指向性[/color]技能时才会触发。可通过手动施放技能观察是否出现瞄准光标来判断该技能是否为指向性技能。"
"34UQ","Some abilities will mention that they have an [color=GOLD]Attack speed adjusted chance[/color] to trigger. What this means is that if the ability has a base 10% chance to trigger on attack, then this ability will trigger at the same rate for towers with different attack speeds.
 
For a tower with 1.0 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 1.0 = 0.10 = 10%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
 
For a tower with 0.5 second attack speed, the ability will trigger [color=GOLD][0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05 = 5%][/color] of the time. In a 10 second period, the ability will on average trigger one time.
","若某技能描述提及具备[color=GOLD]攻速加权的触发几率[/color]，则意味着其基础触发几率会根据防御塔攻击速度动态适配。例如：某技能在攻击时具有10%基础触发几率，不同攻速的防御塔最终触发频率将保持一致。

例如：
攻击速度为1.0秒的防御塔，实际触发几率为[color=GOLD][0.10 × 1.0 = 0.10 = 10%][/color]，即平均每10秒触发一次。
攻击速度为0.5秒的防御塔，实际触发几率为[color=GOLD][0.10 × 0.5 = 0.05 = 5%][/color]，但同样平均每10秒触发一次。"
"258N","Not all damage increasing stats are the same, some can increase total damage by more than others because they are [color=GOLD]multiplicative[/color].
 
Here's an example:
 
You have a tower with 100 base damage, 1s attack speed, 0% crit chance. The tower has 2 inventory slots and you have 3 items:
Item A gives +40% attack damage
Item B gives +40% attack damage
Item C gives +40% damage to bosses
 
Let's say that the next wave will be a boss.
 
If you equip Item A and Item B, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 180[/color] damage.
 
If you equip Item A and Item C, the tower will deal:
[color=GOLD]100 * (1.0 + 0.4) * (1.0 + 0.4) = 196[/color] damage.
 
As you can see, Item C looks like it should provide the same increase as other items but in reality the actual bonus is greater.
 
In general, stats are broken down into categories. Stats within one category are additive while stats between categories multiply with each other. Here's a list of all categories which can affect damage:
 
- Base attack damage flat
- Base attack damage %
- Attack damage flat
- Attack damage %
- Attack speed
- Spell damage %
- Damage against creep armor type
- Damage against creep category
- Attack damage received % (on creep)
- Spell damage received % (on creep)
- Damage received from element % (on creep)
- Damage reduction from armor (on creep)

Note that crit chance, crit damage and multicrit can also be considered multiplicative with other categories.
","并非所有伤害增益属性都以相同方式计算，部分具备[color=GOLD]乘算叠加[/color]特性的属性可产生更高的总伤害增幅。

示例说明：

假设某防御塔基础攻击力100点，攻击速度1秒/次，无暴击属性。现有三件装备：
装备A：攻击伤害+40%
装备B：攻击伤害+40%
装备C：对首领伤害+40%

若下波敌人为首领：

佩戴装备A+B时，伤害计算为：
[color=GOLD]100 × (1.0 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 180[/color]

佩戴装备A+C时，伤害计算为
[color=GOLD]100 × (1.0 + 0.4) × (1.0 + 0.4) = 196[/color]

由此可见，相同数值的乘算型增益（装备C）实际效果优于加算型增益。

同类别属性以加算叠加，跨类别属性以乘算叠加。影响伤害的主要属性类别包括：

- 基础攻击力固定值
- 基础攻击力百分比
- 攻击力固定值
- 攻击力百分比
- 攻击速度
- 法术伤害百分比
- 对特定护甲类型伤害
- 对特定兵种伤害
- 敌方受到攻击伤害百分比
- 敌方受到法术伤害百分比
- 敌方受到元素伤害百分比
- 敌方护甲减伤值

注：暴击几率、暴击伤害与多重暴击属性也与其他类别形成乘算关系。"

Another way build powerful defenses is by [color=GOLD]transforming[/color] towers.
 
To [color=GOLD]transform[/color] a tower, start building a tower like you normally would but move the mouse to an existing tower. The tower cursor will turn blue to indicate that you can [color=GOLD]transform[/color] it. Click to complete the process.
 
[color=GOLD]Transforming[/color] replaces a tower with a new tower, keeps the level of the previous tower and also refunds the cost of the previous tower!
