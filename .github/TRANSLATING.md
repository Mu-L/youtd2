# Translation guidance

## How to contribute to translation

Translated text strings are stored in [texts.csv](https://github.com/Praytic/youtd2/blob/main/data/texts.csv).

You can contribute translations like this:
- Edit the texts.csv file
- Create new column for your language, for example "es"
- Add translated strings to that column
- Create a Pull Request once you're done
