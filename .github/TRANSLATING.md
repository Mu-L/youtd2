# Translation guidance

## How to contribute to translation

Translated text strings are stored in texts.csv. This file is not included on Github because it is too big.
Download link: [texts.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dfaUKx5CoU9oVQQ4DgFVJH_twJ7M5k4Q/view?usp=drive_link).

You can contribute translations like this:
1. Download the texts.csv file
2. Edit the texts.csv file
3. Create new column for your language, for example "es"
4. Add translated strings to that column

Then you can submit the changes like this:
1. Create a new Issue on Github
2. Attach changed texts.csv file to the Issue
3. Follow the format from here: https://github.com/Praytic/youtd2/issues/483
