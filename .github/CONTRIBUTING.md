# Contribution guidance

## How to contribute

You can contribute in different ways:

- Report a bug in Issues
- Write a suggestion in Discussions
- Submit a modification to source code!

For the last one, you will need to download the Godot editor and obtain assets.
Read below to find out how to obtain assets.

## Assets

Follow this link to the assets folder: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U4wTjBu2qo1cInH3IAowsFC5yq56V5uQ?usp=sharing)

Open this link and then follow these steps:

1. Download the whole folder.
2. Copy the contents of the downloaded folder.
3. Paste into 'assets' folder in the game repo.
4. You should see a popup asking whether you want to replace the files - press "Yes".
5. Open the Godot editor and make sure that all of the assets were loaded correctly.

Note that public version of assets contains censored versions of item icons, tower icons and tower sprites. Such assets will look like they are a solid "blue" color.

## Running the game in editor

After you've obtained the Godot editor and assets you can start the editor and try to run the game.

Note that the topic of how to use Godot editor is out of scope of this document. Godot documentation and tutorials are available online.
